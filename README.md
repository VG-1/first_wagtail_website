# Let's make our first Wagtail website

Hello, so I just learnt about wagtail and it's use cases and how to create wagtail website so I will just write what I learnt through this tutorial.

Whether you're a web developer, designer, or content creator, this tutorial will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to build a Wagtail website from scratch.

### First of all what is Wagtail?
Wagtail is open-source Python CMS ( ) being trusted by organisations like NASA, NHS, Caltech,University of Penselvania.

*If I'd to explain wagtail to a 5 year old kid, here is how it will look like*:-

Wagtail is like a tool that helps people make websites. It's like a box of building blocks that you can use to create a website by putting different things together, like text, pictures, videos, and more. It also helps grown-ups who take care of websites to organize and manage all the things that go on the website, like checking if everything looks good and deciding when to show things to other people. Just like how you use your toy blocks to build a tower, Wagtail helps grown-ups build websites!

Now I guess you have got a bit idea of what exactly Wagtail is so without a further let's get straight toward making our first wagtail website.

Just open your terminal and run the commands in terminal.

## First let's check the whether we have an appropriate version of Python 3:
